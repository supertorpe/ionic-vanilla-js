# ionic-vanilla-js

This repository contains an Ionic 6 Vanilla Javascript starter with no framework (no Angular, no React, no Vue...)

## src/ionic.js
This file imports and registers every Ionic component you use in your project.
Most of the components are commented to reduce the bundle size.
So you need to uncomment the components you are going to use in your project.

## src/main.js
This is the entry point. It includes an example of dynamic loading a couple of icons.
